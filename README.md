### "Stay safe, stay healthy with MediQuick - Your trusted source for detecting counterfeit drugs"

## Blockchain Based Counterfeit Drug Detection System

MediQuick is a blockchain-based system designed to address the critical issue of counterfeit drugs in the pharmaceutical industry. With the aim of ensuring patient safety and protecting public health, MediQuick offers an innovative solution that leverages blockchain technology to track and authenticate medications throughout the supply chain. By scanning a unique QR code on each product, consumers and stakeholders can access comprehensive information about the drug, including its origin, manufacturing details, and journey from production to distribution. This level of transparency not only empowers patients to make informed decisions but also enables healthcare providers and regulators to identify and prevent the circulation of counterfeit medicines. MediQuick's robust and secure platform integrates blockchain, React Js, Node.js and Cryptographic Digital Signature(Eddsa) technologies to detect anomalies, authenticate drugs, and establish a trusted ecosystem for all participants in the pharmaceutical supply chain.
